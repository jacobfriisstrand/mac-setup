Use this when asked to fetch tasks from ClickUp.\nargument-hint: \"TICKET-ID\"\n---\n\n## Step 1: Fetch the task\n\n- Use ClickUp MCP `clickup_get_task` with task_id `$ARGUMENTS` and `subtasks: true`\n- Use `clickup_get_task_comments` to fetch all comments on the task\n- Summarize the task requirements before proceeding\n\n## Step 2: Check for Figma links\n\n- Scan the task description and comments for Figma URLs (`figma.com`)\n- If found, use the Figma MCP to retrieve design context\n- Note any UI text/copy from the Figma designs for translation reference\n\n## Step 3: Solve the task\n\nFollow these rules while implementing:\n\n- **Pint linting** — Only run if PHP files were changed\n- **Docker exec** — Never run PHP/database commands directly. Always: `docker exec blueventure_php <command>`\n- **Translations** — No hardcoded user-facing strings. Use `lang/en` files. Never edit `resources/js/i18n/en.json` (auto-generated). Never add translation fallbacks (they are deterministic).\n- **Figma vs codebase** — If a translation differs from Figma, edit it to match Figma\n- **Backend tests** — Run `make prepare-tests` before running tests via `docker exec blueventure_php`\n- **Framework conventions** — Use latest Vue + Laravel best practices and project skills, but this skill's rules always win\n"

Use this when a branch is done and ready for review.\n---\n\n## Step 1: Run CodeRabbit review\n\n- Run `coderabbit --plain --prompt-only --type uncommitted` with a **10-minute timeout**\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT run this in the background. Do NOT proceed until CodeRabbit finishes. Do NOT stop it early. Wait for complete output before moving on.**\n\n## Step 2: Fix critical issues\n\n- Evaluate all fixes and considerations from the CodeRabbit output\n- **Fix major and critical issues only** — ignore nits and minor suggestions\n- Implement the fixes\n\n## Step 3: Run CodeRabbit review again (only if issues were found)\n\n- **Skip this step entirely if the first review found no critical issues.**\n- Run `coderabbit --plain --prompt-only --type uncommitted` a second time with a **10-minute timeout**\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT run this in the background. Do NOT proceed until CodeRabbit finishes. Do NOT stop it early. Wait for complete output before moving on.**\n\n## Step 4: Suggest atomic commits\n\n- Review all uncommitted changes on the branch\n- Extract the task ID from the branch name (e.g. branch `feat/BLUE-123456-add-login` → task ID is `BLUE-123456`)\n- Suggest a set of atomic commits that logically group the changes\n- Each commit message MUST follow this format: `<conventional-commit-scope>(TASK-ID): <commit-message>`\n  - Example: `fix(BLUE-123456): removing unused css classes`\n  - The TASK-ID is extracted from the branch name and MUST be the same for ALL commits\n  - Only the scope and message change between commits\n- **CRITICAL: Do NOT create commits automatically.** Present the suggested commits to the user and WAIT for explicit approval before creating any commits\n\n## Step 5: Finalize\n\n- **Only run the review loop twice.** If no critical issues remain after the second run, you are done — ignore any remaining nits.\n- Provide a summary of:\n  - What critical issues were found in the first review\n  - What fixes were applied\n  - Whether the second review passed clean or what was left as acceptable\n  - The atomic commits that were created (or suggested)"
